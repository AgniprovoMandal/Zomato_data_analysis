I modified the data according to my need and then analyzed the dataset for finding out zomato restaurant trends and customer preferences. The questions whose answers I found out after analyzing the dataset are given below- 
1) What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2) How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3) What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
4) What is the average spending of couples who order their foods online?
5) Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating? 
6) Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that zomato can provide those customers with some good offers?
# Key Take-aways:-
1) Used pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn for this analysis.
2) Modified and cleaned the data according to my needs.
3) Plotted various features of data for maximized information extraction.
